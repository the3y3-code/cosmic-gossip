**Cosmic Gossip** is a twist on the classic Space Invaders. Instead of just mindlessly attacking, these aliens have lives, opinions, and a lot to say!

Powered by the **Google Gemini API**, they banter about everything from intergalactic rent prices to today's weirdest Earth news. Watch them gossip, argue, and even beg for mercy as you blast them away.
